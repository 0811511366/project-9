  <h1>pollution</h1> 
  <p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. Landfills collect garbage and other land pollution in a central location. Many places are running out of space for landfills.</p>
  <ul>
  <li id="mariam">Air pollution</li>
  <p>Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution.</p>
  <li id="mariam2">land pollution</li>
  <p>land pollution, the deposition of solid or liquid waste materials on land or underground in a manner that can contaminate the soil and groundwater, threaten public health, and cause unsightly conditions and nuisances.</p>
  <li id="mariam3">water pollution</li>
  <p>Water pollution occurs when harmful substances—often chemicals or microorganisms—contaminate a stream, river, lake, ocean, aquifer, or other body of water, degrading water quality and rendering it toxic to humans or the environment. This widespread problem of water pollution is jeopardizing our health.</p>
  </ul>
  <p id="mariam4">(pollution is not harmful,and its not a problem to pollute the air.)</p>
